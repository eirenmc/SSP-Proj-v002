This is Assignment 02 of Server Side Programming I, as part of my 3rd Year Creative Multimedia course. This assignment is a portfolio building application created using NodeJS and Express.

The aim of this assignment is to build an application that allows a user to login and build their online portfolio website. I will need to provide a means for te user to put up their content, edit it and view it. Also each user needs to be able to login to their own account.

This application does the following:
	
	- It can upload images to a folder called uploads in the public directory
	- It is responsive for mobile and tablets
	- It can display the fields entered in the 'New Project' page
	- It stores all the information in a Mongo DB
	- It has secure login and also without correct login credential you can't access any editing page related to the portfolio builder
	- User login is custom, a user must create an account if they want to edit the portfolio
	
Note: When using assignment, in order to login, you must create an account first, the username and password caergories are in fact your login details, 
without them you will not be able to access pages such as: admin, project entry and project list
